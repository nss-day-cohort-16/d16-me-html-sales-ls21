				<h2>Values</h2>
				<p>Constant Learning. Hearty Laughter. Deep Conversation. Reading between the lines. A perfectly crafted cup of tea. Physical motion. Testing Limits. Shattering Boundaries. Language in all its varied forms. Making cross-cultural boundaries disappear. And crafting code to do it all faster, better, and easier than ever before. </p>
			</article>
			<article class="col-md-3">
				<h2>Goals</h2>
				<p>Using what I've learned to build powerful software to bring people together across time, distance, languages, religions, and all those other artificial boundaries societies have established. The primary mechanism I've found to do this is language. It's that saying - "speak to a man in a language he understands and you speak to his mind. Speak to a man in his own language and you speak to his heart." The ultimate goal: speak to as many hearts as I can through software that solves people's problems. </p>

				<h2>Hobbies</h2>
				<p>Avid outdoorswoman, athlete, reader, writer, language learner, and traveler. I enjoy camping and hiking, long roadtrips, rigorous exercise of whatever kind I can find, great books (which doesn't "necessarily" mean literature), and, most of all, playing with words. I strive to be a wordsmith, in languages as diverse as Danish and Dutch. You'll often find me at a coffee shop honing just that craft when I'm not writing code.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Small town farm girl born and raised in Tennessee. Received the Gates' Foundation Millennium Scholarship. Moved out west to apple country (aka Eastern Washington) to attend Gonzaga University (<a href="http://www.gozags.com">GO ZAGS!!!</a>). Studied abroad in Spain and Portugal. Graduated with a BA in Political Science and Spanish. Awarded the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship. Moved to the nation's capital, Washington DC, to attend Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service. Dabbled in marketing and event management. Researched in Brazil. Worked full time at the State Department. Graduated in May 2008. Started a full time gig as a full fledged dyed in the wool diplomat. Did tours in Angola, Brazil, Germany, and Panama. Bailed on the Foreign Service to learn to code. Ended up at Nashville Software School. Where I go from here is anyone's guess.</p>
				<p>Multilingual and deeply interested in machine learning and natural language processing. Would LOVE the chance to be on the cutting edge of the latest software developments in those fields.</p>

				<h2>Past Projects</h2>
				<p>Check back often to see the latest of what I've pushed out to the word. Currently, it's a work in progress, but you'll soon see samples of basic HTML, more CSS focused work, and a whole lot of Javascript. As I get more into building single page applications, you'll see examples of those here as well. </p>
